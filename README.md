# Pipeline_for_eDNA_with_Nanopore
 Set of scripts to run Kraken 2 and other tools onto Nanopore data (or any data in general). 

These scripts are intended for DNA data from the Nanopore sequencer, but in general the same can be used for other sequencing technologies. These scripts are bespoke for training purposes, but available for open use to anyone.


Please read the Wiki for a tutorial on how to run analyses.

For the moment, the analysis using the Kraken 2 classifier is up there.
Decona pipeline analysis will be up very soon.

** This repository is still under construction and I will add more features and tutorials as they become ready. **
